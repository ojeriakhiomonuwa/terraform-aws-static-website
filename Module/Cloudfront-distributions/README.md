# The code in `main.tf` is a Terraform configuration for creating an Amazon CloudFront distribution. It sets up a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that serves static website content from an Amazon S3 bucket, with specific settings for performance, security, and caching. 
### Key components of the code

`resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "this"`   
This declares a Terraform resource of the type `aws_cloudfront_distribution`.
`"this"` is the local name given to the resource within the Terraform configuration. 
`origin block` 
This block specifies the origin server, which is the source of the content CloudFront will distribute.
* `domain_name = var.s3_bucket_domain:` The origin is an S3 bucket, whose domain name is retrieved from a Terraform variable named `s3_bucket_domain`.
* `origin_id = "s3-origin":` A unique identifier for this origin. 
`enabled = true`
This setting ensures that the CloudFront distribution is created and activated.
`default_root_object = "index.html"`
If a user requests the root URL of your website (e.g., https://example.com/), CloudFront will automatically serve the `index.html` file. 
`default_cache_behavior block`   
This configures how CloudFront handles requests for content by default.
`target_origin_id = "s3-origin":` Associates this behavior with the S3 origin defined earlier.
`viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https":`   Forces all viewer connections to use HTTPS. Any HTTP requests are automatically redirected to the HTTPS version.  
`allowed_methods = ["GET", "HEAD"]:`   Specifies that CloudFront will only respond to `GET and HEAD HTTP methods`, which are standard for retrieving static content.
`cached_methods = ["GET", "HEAD"]:` Defines which methods are cached.
`compress = true:` Enables compression for supported file types, reducing the size of the content delivered to viewers.
`cache_policy_id = "4135ea2d-6df8-44a3-9df3-4b5a84be39ad":` Uses a managed AWS cache policy called `Managed-CachingDisabled.`
This specific policy disables caching, ensuring that the latest version of the content is always requested from the S3 origin. This is useful for dynamic content or during development when you want immediate updates. 
`viewer_certificate block`   
This block configures the SSL/TLS certificate for secure HTTPS connections.
* `acm_certificate_arn = var.acm_certificate_arn:`  
The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the SSL certificate is fetched from a Terraform variable. This certificate is managed by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
* `ssl_support_method = "sni-only":` Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) for serving HTTPS traffic. This is the recommended and most cost-effective method, as it allows CloudFront to serve multiple SSL certificates from a single IP address. 
`restrictions` block 
This block defines any restrictions on content distribution.
`geo_restriction:` Configures geographic restrictions.
`restriction_type = "none":` This setting explicitly disables any geographic restrictions, allowing content to be distributed to users worldwide.
