## The provided code defines three AWS S3 resources using Terraform. These resources work together to create an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting with public read access.
`resource "aws_s3_bucket" "this"`:
This block creates an Amazon S3 bucket.
`"aws_s3_bucket"` specifies the type of AWS resource being created (an S3 bucket).
`"this"` is a local name or identifier for this specific resource within the Terraform configuration.
`bucket = var.bucket_name` assigns the name of the S3 bucket using a variable named `bucket_name`. This allows the bucket name to be easily configured without modifying the core resource definition.
`resource "aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration" "this"`:
This block configures the previously created S3 bucket to function as a static website host.
`bucket = aws_s3_bucket.this.id` links this configuration to the specific S3 bucket created in the first block by referencing its ID.
`index_document { suffix = "index.html" }`specifies that index.html will be the default document served when a user accesses the root of the website or a directory.
`error_document { key = "error.html" }` defines error.html as the custom error page to be served for 4xx errors (e.g., "Not Found").
`resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "public_read"`:
This block attaches a bucket policy to the S3 bucket, granting public read access to its objects.
`bucket = aws_s3_bucket.this.id` links this policy to the S3 bucket.
`policy = jsonencode(...)` defines the bucket policy in JSON format.
`"Version": "2012-10-17"` specifies the policy language version.
`"Statement"` contains an array of policy statements.
The single statement grants:
`"Effect": "Allow":` Permits the specified actions.
`"Principal": "*":` Allows access to any principal (anyone).
`"Action": ["s3:GetObject"]:` Grants permission to retrieve objects from the bucket.
`"Resource": "${aws_s3_bucket.this.arn}/*"`: Applies this permission to all objects within the specified S3 bucket, identified by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
